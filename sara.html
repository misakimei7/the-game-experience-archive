            <h6>About</h6>
            <p class="py-3">The sketch by Sara, shows us her experience playing Hopscotch. Through her narration, we learn more about her time spent with her cousins, her fun childhood days, how she remembers and how her motivation to play games changed over time.</p>
            <h6>Conversation</h6>
            <p class="py-3">
              Drawing is something i like to do. I felt confident expressing my thoughts. Even though I couldn't express each and everything, I could recall and draw. I felt sketching made it easier to express the totality of what happened. The colours express the good old days just got back. I recalled the old laughter and fun I had. "Balyakal smaranakal" (Childhood memories). <span class="snippet">My cousin Jo is denner of Hide and seek. He count's till  50. My sisters and brother hide around the house. I hide behind the mango tree cause its close by to go to the starting sat point.</span> <span class="snippet">My sisters hide near the shed.</span> <span class="snippet">Our family cat on the wall. brother hiding near the boundary wall.</span> <span class="snippet">We liked fooling our cousin, the denner. Making him lose was fun.</span> We also had more players, our neighbours. I couldn't sketch them in this scene, but they will be hiding in other parts of the house. <span class="snippet">The alphonso mango tree is what gives us shade and an epitome of our playing days. The area  around it is were we play and it would smell of mangoes and smoke from firewood stove used for cooking. Our house is the tharavad. So our cousins come over during summer holidays to play.</span><br><br>
              One among my two cousin brother initiates the game. I don't generally call them to play. I join them when they call.<br><br>
              We played hide n seek with boys and girls. Boys used to play role playing games alot. They become police and thief. We don't have much role in the game. They become the centre and we are some guard without much roll. Without us they play golli game. They used to keep them as asset without losing as a precious gem. They used collect match box pictures also. They dont include us assuming we don't know the tricks. We girls used to play kallu kalli, valla pottu kalli, house game -making with mud or cooking games with coconut shell, leaves and sand, used veg peels. Boys don't join us for these. I remember this one day when my sibling and her friends created wedding rituals between myself and our neighbour. They made us exchange flower garlands and announced our wedding. They prepared sadhya for the guests (other cousins and friends) using natural materials like flowers, grinded leaves, twigs, old vessels, soil etc.<br><br>
              I liked playing others games such as Kavadi kalli, Raniyum kollum, Kallu kalli, Paambum Konniyum, bluff word games, Kaattadi, EMRS. I preferred siting games.<br><br>
              I did not prefer the outdoor. I like seeing others playing with me . I mostly prefer indoor. The games I play now are boardgames and mobile games. I enjoy the comfort of bed with a window to let cool breeze.<br><br>
              This is more fun for me to watch and play compared to indoor ones which are competitive. There would be a lot of laughter, i remember their sounds, their actions.<br><br>
              I don't play hide n seek anymore. But i can if I really have to. I like to watch children play. I have taught the game to my younger siblings, my children and their friends.
